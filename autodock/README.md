# Overview
This collection of packages aims to provide a robust autodocking procedure for a TurtleBot 2.0. Five packages are provided in the src directory:
- rl_common:     Some files that are common to both agents and environments.
- rl_msgs:       Definitions of ROS messages for agents and envs to communicate.
- rl_agent:      A library of some RL agents (such as Q-Learning).
- rl_env:        A library of some RL environments.
- rl_experiment: Code to run some RL experiments without ROS message passing.

The core packages are provided by Todd Hester's reinforcement learning ROS stack (rl-texplore-pkg). Documentation and a tutorial for these packages can be found at these links, respectively:
